I find it fasinating to discover how other professionals have their workspace setup, but I've never shared my setup and I thought it was about time. So I'd like to rundown a list of what I use in my daily workflow.

## Hardware

### 13" Macbook Air

This was my first Apple purchase a few months ago and it's a lovely piece of Hardware, the best laptop I've ever owned. Before that I had a nice Windows gaming computer which I spent and lot of time and a lot more cash on, but I've lost interest in spending my time and money on anything past casual gaming on my iPhone.

It's my primary computer, although the specification is a lot less than what I got used to with my old PC it's enough for what I need it for. I got the 13" 4GB/128GB version, it runs fine and only starts to strain when I have Parallels running with Visual Studio open for clients.

### 27" Dell Monitor

Sometimes a laptop monitor just doesn't cut it, especially when I'm not working on site with a client or on the move. That's when it makes sense to have an external, the extra screen real estate is great when really getting to business at my desk.

### Wireless Keyboard

### Trackpad
